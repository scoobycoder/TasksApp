#Tasks Application

__Skill Level:__ Intermediate  
__Time Limit:__ n/a  

Create an application with the framework of your choice (Rails, Django, etc) that tracks tasks that you'd like to complete. The goal of this challenge is to build a simple [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) application that persists data in a database and provides [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) functionality to the user.
